# CODENAMES

This repo contains the front end code used for the popular board game, Code Names. I created this project to teach myself React. While the front end works very well, the back end is not properly set up. This is because I was more focused on teaching myself React rather than database management.

### To Deploy Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master
npm run predeploy
npm run deploy
```

### To Run Code

You need front end repo (found here), the back end pack server, and the back end socket server.

To start the front end

```bash
npm start
```

To start the back end
```bash
flask run
```
